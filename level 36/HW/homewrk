# Hexadecimal (Hex) Color System:
# - Characteristics: Hex colors are a way of representing colors using hexadecimal values.
# - Writing Style: A hex color code starts with a '#' followed by six hexadecimal digits.
#                  Each pair of digits represents the red, green, and blue components of the color, respectively.
#                  For example, #FF5733 corresponds to red (FF), green (57), and blue (33).
# - Rules:
#    - Hex values range from 00 to FF, where 00 is the lowest intensity and FF is the highest.
#    - Valid hex digits include 0-9 and A-F.
# - Pros:
#    - Compact representation of colors.
#    - Easy to read and use in web development and design.
# - Cons:
#    - Not as intuitive for humans to understand the color just by looking at the code.
#    - Limited to the RGB color space.

# Example of Hex color code:

background_color = "#FF5733"  # Orange color (Red: FF, Green: 57, Blue: 33)


# RGB Color System:
# - Characteristics: RGB colors are represented using the red, green, and blue color model.
# - Writing Style: An RGB color value is written as rgb(r, g, b), where r, g, and b are integers
#                  representing the intensity of red, green, and blue, respectively.
#                  Each value ranges from 0 to 255.
#                  For example, rgb(255, 87, 51) corresponds to red (255), green (87), and blue (51).
# - Rules:
#    - Values for red, green, and blue must be between 0 and 255.
#    - The intensity values determine the mix of colors to produce the final color.
# - Pros:
#    - More intuitive and easier to understand the color composition.
#    - Flexible for various applications beyond web development.
# - Cons:
#    - Less compact compared to hex codes.
#    - Still limited to the RGB color space.

# Example of RGB color code:

background_color_rgb = "rgb(255, 87, 51)"  # Orange color (Red: 255, Green: 87, Blue: 51)
